# üè° Australian Suburb Housing Price Forecaster
### Version 1.2
### Author: Robert Li ([dr-robert-li](https://github.com/dr-robert-li/))
    
This Machine Learning powered application uses finetuned XGBoost advanced regression model and a hedonic model of valuation to forecast housing prices for Australian suburbs over a 50-year period using machine learning and real estate market data.

## Features

### Smart Suburb Analysis
- Empty input: Returns top growth suburbs nationally
- State input: Analyzes top suburbs per specified state
- Custom input: Detailed analysis for specific suburbs

### Property Criteria Customization
- Bedrooms (0-15)
- Bathrooms (0-20)
- Car Spaces (0-10)
- Land Size (sqm)
- Max Initial Median Price (AUD)
- Setting any criteria to 0 analyzes all properties
- Dwelling Type Selection:
  - House: Traditional single-family homes
  - Apartment: Multi-unit residential buildings
  - Townhouse: Connected row housing

### Advanced Analytics
- Price projections with confidence intervals:
  - 5-year (Very High Confidence): Near-term market dynamics
  - 25-year (High Confidence): Primary analysis timeframe
  - 50-year (Moderate Confidence): Long-term trend indicators
- Monte Carlo simulations for price modeling
- Multiple confidence intervals (1 Std.d 68% and 2 Std.d 95%)
- Nominal vs Inflation-Adjusted Values:
  - Current inflation impact
  - Forecast inflation rates
  - Inflation volatility modeling
- Key market indicators:
  - Dwelling type specific growth adjustments
  - School quality scores
  - Infrastructure ratings
  - Flood and climate risk assessments
  - Population growth trends
  - Crime rates
  - Public transport accessibility
  - Distance to CBD based decay
  - Quality and distance of commercial centers
  - Quality and distance of parks and bodies of water
  - Household demographics
    - Income
    - Age
    - Size
  - Supply Market Analysis
    - Current months of housing inventory
    - Supply ratio benchmarking against 6-month standard
    - Dynamic growth adjustments based on supply conditions

### Optional Deep Market Reasoning
- Comprehensive market analysis for each suburb:
  - Primary 25-year growth trajectory analysis
  - Near-term (5-year) market opportunities
  - Long-term (50-year) sustainability indicators
  - Supply-demand dynamics
  - Infrastructure impact assessment
  - Demographic trend implications
  - Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
  - Crime impact and security considerations
  - Inflation effects analysis
- Research citations and market data sources
- Exportable in RTF and TXT formats

#### NOTE: This uses Deep Reasoning and Chain of Thought. It is both expensive and slow. Use with care especially for large datasets of multiple suburbs.

### Model Fine-tuning
- Progressive learning with synthetic data generation
- Supply-aware parameter adjustments
- Volatility modeling for different market conditions and dwelling types
- Confidence interval calculations using Monte Carlo simulations

### Data Export Options
- JSON: Complete dataset with all metrics
- CSV: Tabular format for spreadsheet analysis
- TXT: Human-readable detailed reports
- XLSX: Excel workbook with formatted data
